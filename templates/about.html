        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he
                and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he
                quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in
                TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his
                shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                which would remain with him even in death.

            <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of
                Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.            
                As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they
                that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin.            
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
                come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin.            
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named
                Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may
                have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin,
                when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger
                brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and
                Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

            <h3>Ori</h3>
            <p>
                Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and Nori. In
                the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the
                other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other
                Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

                Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori. In TA
                2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of
                Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

                Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both
                shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in
                the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

                his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven
                out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf
                warrior worked as a toy maker.

                While answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to the meeting at Bag End with his brother Bombur
                and cousin Bifur. He accompanied Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and rest of Thorin's Company across Wilderland to
                the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim the Dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug.

                Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line,
                although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere
                between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years,"
                and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA
                2763.
